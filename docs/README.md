# Web Service Template

This project is a template for building automation systems in web projects. It utilizes Flask, a popular Python web framework, to provide a simple web service structure.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azmisahin/azmisahin-software-web-service-template-flask-python-v1.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd azmisahin-software-web-service-template-flask-python-v1
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - Windows:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - Unix or MacOS:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Usage

Run the web service using the provided console script:

```bash
web-service-template run
```

## SSL/TLS certificate
If you have not yet created an SSL/TLS certificate and do not have an existing certificate file, you can create a temporary certificate in a few steps. The following commands will create a temporary certificate containing its own private key and certificate:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout private-key.pem -out public-cert.pem -days 365
```
This command creates the private key (private-key.pem) and certificate (public-cert.pem) files. The -days parameter determines the validity period of the certificate; In the example above it is set to 365 days.

If you are going to use it in a real project, it is recommended that you obtain a valid SSL/TLS certificate from a certificate authority (CA). These certificates are usually provided for a fee or free of charge. You can also get free SSL/TLS certificates from a service like Let's Encrypt.
